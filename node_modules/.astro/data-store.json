To refresh myself, I went back to look through my old assignments, grades, and notes.\n\nThis was my first class in OMSCS, and I took it based on all that I read online about it being a good starter course in the program, especially for those taking the ML specialization. I can attest that this is true. This course is very doable.\n\nI would recommend that if you are starting the OMSCS ML spec and you have experience with Python, Pandas, and Sci-Kit Learn, skip ML4T and just take ML right off the jump. ML4T doesn’t teach you anything that isn’t covered better in ML, and the workload is pretty high, so you will find yourself with a lot of hours sunk into report writing if you take both. The financial aspect is pretty minimal, and it's really not worth taking the class for this specifically.\n\nI think you only take ML4T if you are new to Python or data science and you think you need a slower on-ramp into ML proper, but the prerequisite knowledge you need for ML is much lower than you might think, so don’t count yourself out.\n\nFrom where I sit now, halfway through the program, I do regret taking this class a little bit only because I wish I had taken something that didn’t overlap with ML so much. I should have dove straight into ML. Especially because as you get deeper, you do get a little jaded and worn down, so it's best to tackle the big things while you are fresh.\n\nHowever, if you don’t know if OMSCS is for you or if you think there is a good chance you will not finish and just want a taste, ML4T is a very realistic course load, although it is a bit more writing-heavy than other courses. But if you know you are here to finish and want to get the most out of your time or maybe just don’t want to duplicate effort, ML4T is a hard skip.","src/content/blog/omscs-review-ml4t.mdx",[47],"../../assets/blog-placeholder-4.jpg","a2a89a05babc0ee3","omscs-review-ns",{"id":49,"data":51,"body":20,"filePath":56,"assetImports":57,"digest":58,"deferredRender":25},{"title":52,"description":53,"pubDate":54,"topics":55,"heroImage":43},"Course Review: Network Science","review for NS",["Date","2021-05-11T07:00:00.000Z"],[18],"src/content/blog/omscs-review-ns.mdx",[47],"039569d14cf9912c","omscs-review-sdp",{"id":59,"data":61,"body":20,"filePath":65,"assetImports":66,"digest":67,"deferredRender":25},{"title":62,"description":15,"pubDate":63,"topics":64,"heroImage":43},"Course Review: Software Development Process",["Date","2021-05-11T07:00:00.000Z"],[18],"src/content/blog/omscs-review-sdp.mdx",[47],"8b59aa9b1968b13c","old-blogs/old-blogs",{"id":68,"data":70,"body":78,"filePath":79,"assetImports":80,"digest":82,"deferredRender":25},{"title":71,"description":72,"pubDate":73,"topics":74,"heroImage":77},"Some Old Websites of Mine","review of my old sites",["Date","2025-07-13T07:00:00.000Z"],[75,76],"self-hosting","small web","__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../../assets/blog-placeholder-5.jpg","import { Image } from \"astro:assets\";\nimport hugoApero from \"./hugo-apero-example.png\";\nimport joaHome from \"./joy-of-analysis-homepage.png\";\nimport joaBlog from \"./joy-of-analysis-blog-example.png\";\n\nI was inspired to re-do my website by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x6SCSz7g5I) to move it away from a glorified buisness card and to more of a blog with something feeling a little more homegrown.\n\n\u003CImage\n  src={hugoApero}\n  alt=\"Screenshot of Hugo Apero example\"\n  width={800}\n  height={450}\n/>\n\n\u003CImage\n  src={joaHome}\n  alt=\"Screenshot of Hugo Apero example\"\n  width={800}\n  height={450}\n/>\n\n\u003CImage\n  src={joaBlog}\n  alt=\"Screenshot of Hugo Apero example\"\n  width={800}\n  height={450}\n/>","src/content/blog/old-blogs/old-blogs.mdx",[81],"../../../assets/blog-placeholder-5.jpg","6e6df02b92468022","user-dev-spectrum",{"id":83,"data":85,"body":91,"filePath":92,"assetImports":93,"digest":94,"deferredRender":25},{"title":86,"description":87,"pubDate":88,"topics":89,"heroImage":43},"The User Developer Spectrum","Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",["Date","2021-05-11T07:00:00.000Z"],[90],"old","As an R user, especially as one who leans heavily on packages and frameworks to do the heavy lifting for me, I have developed a bit of an insecurity about my ability to write code. I contracted this insecurity from hanging out in online spaces where other people who write code hangout, not just data scientists but webdev's, data engineers, and whatever it is exactly that people who write C++ do. In these spaces the only time R comes up is when it is being compared to python, but mostly it is just absent from the conversation.\n\nAnd I understand why this is the case. R is a very specialized language that has a specific function - analyze data. And I love using it for that, but I was worried I was spending my time learning a very specialized language with non-transferable skills. I wanted to ensure I was becoming good at the fundamental coding skills as well as expanding my analytical toolkit.\n\nThe source of this insecurity of mine was confusion about the sorts of things that I need to know. Code is a big world and I only work in a small corner of it. I did not have a clear distinction in my mind about what the difference was between the type of code it takes to do a good analysis and where traditional software development skills fit into this work.\n\nHowever, after a bit of digging I found that my lack of clarity around this topic was actually a function of one of the primary goals of the original S language (the precursor to R):\n\n> “The ambiguity [of the S language] is real and goes to a key objective: we wanted users to be able to begin in an interactive environment, where they did not consciously think of themselves as programming. Then as their needs became clearer and their sophistication increased, they should be able to slide gradually into programming, when the language and system aspects would become more important.”\n>\n> ~ John Chambers, one of the creators of S\n\nSo the line between user and dev is not a hard line in the sand. It's actually a spectrum. On one end there are the users of software and on the other there are developers.\n\nI am really not sure where the line between developer and user is drawn, and I have no interest in drawing it. The last thing I want is contribute to any gatekeeping. I think it is fair to say when you are cleaning data with dplyr functions you are being a more of a user of software, and when you are designing your analysis pipeline you are using more developer skills. However, for me at least, it has been beneficial to be able to be aware of where you are on this \"user-developer” spectrum as it can help you be clear on the skills and tools needed for an analysis.\n\nSometimes a project might be complex enough that it requires you to start leveraging the object oriented programming capabilities of R directly, and when this time comes it would be beneficial to know that you need a different set of skills than the ones you have developed as a user.\n\nDifferent projects will require you to work at a different places on this spectrum. And you will side up and down this spectrum during the course of an analysis.","src/content/blog/user-dev-spectrum.mdx",[47],"0a01d2d9fffda56c","fieldNotes",["Map",97,98],"stinkhorns-modoc/stinkhorns-modoc",{"id":97,"data":99,"body":105,"filePath":106,"assetImports":107,"digest":108,"deferredRender":25},{"title":100,"description":87,"pubDate":101,"updatedDate":102,"topics":103,"heroImage":77},"The Stinkhorns of The Modoc Preserve",["Date","2024-06-01T07:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-07-14T07:00:00.000Z"],[104],"Fungi","import image0 from './image0.JPEG';\nimport image1 from './image1.JPEG';\nimport image2 from './image2.JPEG';\nimport image3 from './image3.JPEG';\nimport image4 from './image4.JPEG';\nimport image5 from './image5.JPEG';\nimport LightboxCarousel from '../../../components/mdx/LightboxCarousel.astro';\n\n\u003CLightboxCarousel\n  images={[\n    { src: image0.src, alt: 'Stinkhorn 0' },\n    { src: image1.src, alt: 'Stinkhorn 1' },\n    { src: image2.src, alt: 'Stinkhorn 2' },\n    { src: image3.src, alt: 'Stinkhorn 3' },\n    { src: image4.src, alt: 'Stinkhorn 4' },\n    { src: image5.src, alt: 'Stinkhorn 5' },\n  ]}\n/>","src/content/fieldNotes/stinkhorns-modoc/stinkhorns-modoc.mdx",[81],"d454925b5397c27a"]
