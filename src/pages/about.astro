  <h5>Pre-data engineering ~2022</h5>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a data scientist at IBM where I currently work on analysis projects related to healthcare and hospital utilization. My background is in environmental science where I have worked on a broad set of projects related to human impacts on the environment, fisheries, and food systems.

  <h5>Back when I was a researcher ~2020</h5>
  <p>Hello, I am a researcher at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. I work on food systems with a focus on fisheries and human impacts on marine environments.</p>

<p>You can take a look at some of the work I do here or peep the publications tab:</p>
