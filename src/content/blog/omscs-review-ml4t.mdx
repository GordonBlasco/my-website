Disclaimer: A lot of time passed between when I finished this course and when I wrote this review. To refresh myself, I went back to look through my old assignments, grades, and notes.

This was my first class in OMSCS, and I took it based on all that I read online about it being a good starter course in the program, especially for those taking the ML specialization. I can attest that this is true. This course is very doable.

I would recommend that if you are starting the OMSCS ML spec and you have experience with Python, Pandas, and Sci-Kit Learn, skip ML4T and just take ML right off the jump. ML4T doesn’t teach you anything that isn’t covered better in ML, and the workload is pretty high, so you will find yourself with a lot of hours sunk into report writing if you take both. The financial aspect is pretty minimal, and it's really not worth taking the class for this specifically.

I think you only take ML4T if you are new to Python or data science and you think you need a slower on-ramp into ML proper, but the prerequisite knowledge you need for ML is much lower than you might think, so don’t count yourself out.

From where I sit now, halfway through the program, I do regret taking this class a little bit only because I wish I had taken something that didn’t overlap with ML so much. I should have dove straight into ML. Especially because as you get deeper, you do get a little jaded and worn down, so it's best to tackle the big things while you are fresh.

However, if you don’t know if OMSCS is for you or if you think there is a good chance you will not finish and just want a taste, ML4T is a very realistic course load, although it is a bit more writing-heavy than other courses. But if you know you are here to finish and want to get the most out of your time or maybe just don’t want to duplicate effort, ML4T is a hard skip.
