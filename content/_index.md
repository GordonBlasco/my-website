description: "I'm a data scientist at IBM where I currently work on analysis projects related to healthcare and hospital utilization. My background is in environmental science where I have worked on a broad set of projects related to human impacts on the environment, fisheries, and food systems. <br><br>

Primarily, I use SQL and the R programming language in my work to fit models, conduct geospatial analysis, clean data, create visualizations for data driven storytelling, designing and deploying data dashboards, and other tasks common in the data analysis pipeline.
<br><br>
You can find my research projects here or take a look at some of my open sourced code on my GitHub.
